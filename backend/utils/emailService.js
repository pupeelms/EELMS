Hello ${user.fullName || "Valued User"},

Thank you for borrowing items from us. Here are the details of your transaction:

Borrowed Items:
${itemsList}

Due Date: ${dueDate.toLocaleString()}

If you need any manuals for the borrowed items, you can check this Google Drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1j4nEiabLaGCawRq0Xw5-W8yjPGjcYPyS?usp=sharing

Search for the specific name of the item to see if a manual is provided. Please note that manuals may not be available for all items.

Note: Please ensure that the items are returned by the due date to avoid any penalties.

Thank you,
PUP EE LAB
