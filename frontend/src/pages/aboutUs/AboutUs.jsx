          <h2>TEAM STORY</h2>
          <p>
            Four engineering students, each with a passion for innovation and a drive to make a difference, embarked on a journey to revolutionize 
            the Electrical Engineering Laboratory of Polytechnic University of the Philippines. From their early years, their bond was forged through 
            long nights of studying, endless group projects, and a shared vision for a brighter, more efficient future.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            One day, as they struggled with the cumbersome, outdated inventory management system of their lab, the spark of inspiration struck. 
            "Why not create an application to streamline this entire process?" The idea resonated deeply with the group. They saw the potential 
            to transform the chaos of manual borrowing and returning of tools into a seamless digital experience.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            The team began brainstorming and sketching out plans in the Gabriela Silang Hall, each member contributing their unique skills and perspectives. 
            There was Erika, a dedicated coder, who constantly learning the wonders of coding; Carmelle, the organizational wizard, who had a knack for creating efficient workflows; 
            Rose, the tech-savvy designer, whose eye for detail brought their vision to life; and Mary, the problem-solver, who could troubleshoot and refine their ideas until they shone.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            They named their project EELMS, an acronym for Electrical Engineering Laboratory Management System. With a clear goal in mind, they divided tasks and set milestones. 
            Their days were filled with classes and their nights with coding sessions, sometimes lasting until the early hours of the morning. They faced numerous challenges along the way: 
            bugs in the system, disagreements on design choices, and the pressure of balancing their studies with their ambitious project.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            But their determination never wavered. Every obstacle they encountered only strengthened their resolve. They sought guidance from professors, conducted user testing 
            with fellow students, and iterated on their designs until the application was as intuitive and efficient as they envisioned.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Through their journey, they not only developed a groundbreaking application but also forged a deeper bond as a team. Their story is an inspiration, 
            a testament to what can be achieved through collaboration, perseverance, and a shared vision for progress. EELMS was not just an application; it was a reflection 
            of their journey, their passion, and their commitment to making a difference in the world of engineering.
